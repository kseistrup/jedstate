# TODO file for jedstate

22.Jul.1999:	Take a look at the 32-bit dependancy issue.

		Remove alloca() dependancy.

		Write a strrchr() function for those who don't have it.

		Write a decent manual...

21.Jul.1999:	Maybe save file mode along with line and column?  Could come
		in handy for those files with non-standard extensions where
		you enter the file mode manually.  Is it worth the hazzle?

20.Jul.1999:	GNU configure?
