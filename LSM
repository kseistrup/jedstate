Title:          JedState
Version:        0.5.2
Entered-date:   03MAR01
Description:	Jedstate is some sort of an extended mind for John E. Davis'
		splendid text editor jed.  Using jedstate and jed's startup
		and exit hooks as a glue jed "remembers" the position of the
		cursor for all visited files and will automagically jump to
		that position whenever the file is revisited.  The database
		is purgeable based on a time-since-last-view criterion.
		Comes with two sample hooks for easy installation.

Platforms:	Should compile on most unices with GDBM and alloca(), although
		it has only been tested on Linux.  It should be fairly easy to
		rewrite the program to using another dbm if you so wish.
