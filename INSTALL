# INSTALL file for jedstate

How to install jedstate, in one easy lesson:
============================================

  1)  Compile jedstate, possibly tweaking the Makefile first.

  2)  Insert the hook samples into your ~/.jedrc file.  If you do not
      already use the startup/exit hooks you may simply copy one of the
      samples as is, or even do a

        $ jedstate --example >> ~/.jedrc

      from a command line.  The two included samples are identical,
      except one is in RPN.

  3)  Put jedstate somewhere in your PATH, e.g. in the /usr/local/bin/
      directory, then cd to that directory and

        # ln -s jedstate setjedstate
        # ln -s jedstate getjedstate

      i.e., make soft (or hard if you so wish) links from jedstate to
      the two files setjedstate and getjedstate.  If your OS doesn't
      support links you may have to do a couple of plain copies.

  4)  Initialize the database by doing a "jedstate --purge=0" from a
      command line.

  5)  You're all set.  You may, however, want to insert a line in your
      crontab file for easy maintenance of the database -- please take
      a look at the included crontab sample (RedHat users may dump the
      jedstate.cron file into the /etc/cron.daily [or whatever] dir).

  6)  Off you go now! :-)
